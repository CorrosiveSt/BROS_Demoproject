Demo files for the Tabletop simulator project: "Beyond reach of stars"

Formatting help for the future:


### To create a branch
1. Add the issue to the Project board, or move an existing one to "In progress" tab.
2. Make sure to use "Convert to issue" feature in the board
3. Head over to the issue, and apply proper tags (Usually 'enhancement' for new features)
4. From the same sidebar, create the branch for the issue. This should show up in the issue, and it'll be properly linked!
5. No strict naming conventions, just make it so you'll be able to recognize what it's for
6. If you decide to deviate from the initial description, comment the changes and why you made them

### To submit a pull request
1. Test code in Tabletop Simulator
2. Keep committing for working solutions
3. When ready, you *should* be able to just merge yourself. No additional comments needed.
4. Check that the changes still work, and then delete the branch. This will add a note in the issue, where you are able to restore it if anything goes bonkers
